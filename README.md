# School-Projects
These are projects I did at school

## Sample-Store
This was my final project for 12th grade. I simulated a front-end e-commerce page (without any HTML/CSS, I used the turtle module in Python as I was well acquainted with it).
The design isn't amazing, but that's fine for a school project. I used numpy and Pandas to get the transactions done.
In a later version, had integrated this with an SQL database.
There might be bugs in this version, as this was not the final submission. However this was the only file I could recover.
